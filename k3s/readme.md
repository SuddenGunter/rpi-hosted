## Plans

1. VictoriaMetrics + Grafana for collecting metrics.
2. Co2/temp metrics collector based on https://github.com/maddindeiss/co2-monitor
3. Adding some temp/humidity sensor to zigbee network, adding metrics collection from them to VM
4. Change b22 to e27 so I could use my old smart lightbulbs
